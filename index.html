        </summary>
    
          <h4>Choosing the right position</h4>
       <p>  Lavender thrives in sunny locations with well-drained soil.
           Choose a spot in your garden that receives at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight daily.
           Good air circulation is also important to prevent fungal diseases.
      </P>  
        <h4> Preparing the soil</h4> 
       <P> 
            Lavender prefers slightly alkaline soil with a pH between 6.5 and 7.5.
             If your soil is too acidic, you can add some lime to raise the pH. 
             Ensure the soil is well-drained; lavender does not tolerate waterlogged conditions.
             If necessary, amend the soil with sand or gravel to improve drainage.  
       </P>

          <h4>Timing</h4>
          <p> The best time to plant lavender is in the spring, after the last frost. This gives the plants enough time to establish before winter.</p>
            <h4>Spacing</h4>
            <p> Space your lavender plants about 12 to 18 inches apart, depending on the variety. This allows enough room for growth and airflow. </p>     
           <h4>Planting</h4>     
           
         <p> Dig a hole that is slightly larger than the root ball of the plant. 
              Place the lavender plant in the hole, ensuring the top of the root ball is level with the soil surface.
             Fill the hole with soil and gently firm it around the base of the plant.

        <summary>Waterung and Mulching</summary>
        <p>
            Water the newly planted lavender deeply but infrequently. 
            Once established, lavender is drought-tolerant and only needs watering when the soil is dry. 
            Avoid overwatering, as this can lead to root rot. 
            Mulch with a thin layer of gravel or sand to keep the roots cool and improve drainage.

        <summary>Pruning and Maintenance</summary>
      <p> Prune lavender annually to encourage bushy growth and more flowers.
         The best time to prune is in the early spring or after the first bloom. 
         Cut back about one-third of the plant, avoiding cutting into old wood.
         Regular pruning helps maintain the plant's shape and promotes healthy growth.</p>

        <summary>Harvesting Lavender</summary>
       <p> You can harvest lavender flowers once they are in full bloom.
         Cut the stems early in the morning when the oils are most concentrated.
         Hang the cut stems upside down in a cool, dark place to dry.</p>

        <summary>Pest and Disease Management</summary>
        <p>  Lavender is relatively pest and disease-resistant. However, watch out for root rot, especially in poorly drained soils.
         Ensure good air circulation and avoid overcrowding plants to prevent fungal issues.</p>
